        <p1>A web developer resume summary should be concise and highlight your most relevant skills and experience. It should be tailored to the job you are applying for. You can start with a brief introduction that includes your name, job title, and years of experience. Then, you can list your top skills and achievements in bullet points. You can also include any relevant certifications or awards you have received. Here is an example of a web developer resume summary:

        “Web developer with 5 years of experience in developing responsive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. Proficient in developing web applications using ReactJS and NodeJS. Skilled in creating RESTful APIs using ExpressJS and MongoDB. Awarded the Best Web Developer Award at XYZ Company in 2022.”
